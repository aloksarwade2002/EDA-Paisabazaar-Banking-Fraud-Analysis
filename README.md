# 🧠 EDA-Paisabazaar-Banking-Fraud-Analysis

This project performs an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a banking fraud dataset inspired by **Paisabazaar**, an Indian digital financial platform. The primary objective is to uncover **fraud patterns**, understand customer behavior, and extract actionable insights to help in detecting and preventing financial fraud.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Identify fraudulent transactions using data-driven insights  
- Understand customer transaction behavior and patterns  
- Visualize key indicators and anomalies related to fraud  
- Assist in building future fraud detection models with feature insights  

## 📂 Project Workflow

1. **Dataset Understanding** – Structure, data types, and initial observations  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies  
3. **EDA** –  
   - Distribution of transaction types and amounts  
   - Customer-wise transaction summaries  
   - Time-based trends and spikes  
   - Fraud vs. Non-fraud feature comparisons  
4. **Visualization** – Interactive plots using matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly  
5. **Insights & Recommendations** – Key findings to support fraud detection systems

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook / google colab
- Git for version control

## 📊 Sample Visuals

- Heatmaps for correlation analysis  
- Time-series plots showing fraud spikes  
- Box plots comparing fraudulent vs. genuine transactions  

## ✅ Outcome

A set of **well-documented EDA notebooks** that provide deep insights into how fraud manifests in transaction data, which can support the development of **machine learning models** or **business rules** for fraud prevention.
